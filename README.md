to find binary number of a giveninteger, repeatedly multiply it by 2 by using modulus

x = num % 2

to find the remainder aka x 

x will be 1 OR 0, depending if a remiander exists
NOTE: is the number == 0, in binary it is just 0

the binary number is NOT a inteer, it is like a word so I will try using the variable x (which holds the raminders) into a string data type?
